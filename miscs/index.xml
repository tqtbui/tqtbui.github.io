      <description>Some news and online articles featuring me.
 My paper: General Additive Network Effect Model was featured in the “Design and Analysis of Experiments for Data Science” webinar by the New England Journal of Statistics in Data Science. I won the Student Research Presentation Awards in Business and Industrial Statistics and the First Prize in Case Studies in Data Analysis Poster Competition at the SSC Annual Meeting, 2023. I appeared on the news of the Statistical Consulting and Survey Research Unit for my collaborative paper on tax fairness and tax compliance.</description>
