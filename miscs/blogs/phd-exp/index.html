    </div>

    <div class="article-style">
      
      <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I recently submitted my thesis, which marks the end of my long and hard Ph.D. journey. Reflecting on my bumpy road, there are something I wish I knew. I think it will be beneficial to share my thoughts, in case they can be helpful to someone.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The most important keys for success in any field are persistence and consistency. It will be very helpful to have a good working routine, diet and exercise. Good health comes first and everything comes after. Make good use of your student insurance for health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose one recent (in the last 10 years), interesting, high-quality, and impactful paper from a top journal. Try to take your time to understand every single detail of the paper and maybe replicate their simulations. In my experience, this is more effective than reading books in terms of giving you a good idea of the topic you are working on. Next step is to think about possible limitations of the paper and try alleviating these limitations. This will narrow your scope, making your first project feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small steps matter. Get involve in some small and simple projects or collaborations that helps you publish. This will at least give you some sense of achievement. They will look good on your CV, and will help you avoid self blame and ultimately depression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have an ipad or some similar tablets, something that makes you feel comfortable and enjoyable reading papers and take annotations without keeping physical copies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the mathematics. Most of the time, you will be trying to mimic someone else&rsquo;s proof. The key is to check the conditions and come up with twists for your own problem. Note that many mathematical developments are based on the two principles: generalization and approximation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know the top journals in your areas and spend more time reading related literature from those journals. An interesting and high-quality article should be read at least three times: first for the main idea, second or the technical details, and third for the writing and logic flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Ph.D. thesis does not need to change the world. Ph.D. is just a step that will help you get to the next step of your life, so it is best for you to focus on finishing it. Have a good idea of the program requirements, and have a plan with feasible goals that will guide you towards the completion of the program. (This advice comes from Prof <a href="https://www.schonlau.net/">Matthias Scholau</a>. Check out his post on Finishing a Ph.D.!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to know names in your field. Network for help, collaboration and event organization (conference, seminar, symposium, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conferences are good place to showcase your work, learn about your field and network. Learn about conference opportunities and go for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reach out when you are in need, no matter if it is technical or mental. Almost everyone who is taking or has taken the Ph.D. share similar difficulties and hardships. Many people will be able to understand you and will be happy to give you advice. Reaching out not only can help you feel not alone, but also can open collaboration and friendship possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are more developed in research, try keeping the 2/2/2 rule: at any time, maintain 2 projects in early stage, 2 projects in development, and 2 projects close to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For international students: learn about rules and opportunties for immigration and plan accordingly. A suitable status in the country can make you eligible for tuition reduction, scholarships, and internship opportunities. It will also become very handy when you graduate, find a job, and settle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For anyone wondering about life: everyone, no matter religion, nationality, sexual orientation, etc. hopes for peace and love. Practice mindfulness and compassion. Not everything needs to be complicated. The future is yet to come. Focus on what you are at and try your best.</p>
</li>
