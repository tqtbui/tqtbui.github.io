      <description>I would like to continually remind myself of how fortunate I am in my academic journey. While I cannot name each individual, I extend my sincere gratitude to the Professors and Researchers I have worked with or met. Their valuable opportunities, generous support, and thoughtful advice have shaped both my work and my career.</description>
