      <description>Below are the R packages that I developed for the sole purpose of studying, hence will not be maintained. The codes are well-commented to aid understanding algorithms step-by-step. Can be used for teaching or self-studying.
  varngc: Penalized regressions on Vector Autoregressive models. The loss functions used include penalized least square and penalized log-likelihood. The penalty include lasso and group lasso. This package is parallelizable.
  t.regression: Contains regression models from UWaterloo&amp;rsquo;s STAT844 course instructed by Professor Liang Kun, following the notes of Professor Wayne Oldford.</description>

      <title>Why is Deep Learning good?</title>

      <description>Thanks to the David Sprott&amp;rsquo;s Distinguished Lecture by Professor Trevor Hastie and questions raised by Professor Ali Ghodsi in the Q&amp;amp;A session today, I realized that several things about Deep Learning. Why they are so good, I think there are three reasons:
 For me, Deep Learning is just like a stack of linear models, so it is one way of ensemble models together with a certain structure, maybe hierarchical. Hence, the Deep Learning models usually contain more parameters than the classical models, which may explain why it can have better performance with bigger data.</description>
