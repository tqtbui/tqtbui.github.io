      <title>Tutorial packages</title>

      <description>Below are R packages that I developed for the sole purpose of studying. Thus they will not be maintained. The codes are well-commented for step-by-step understanding of algorithms. These can be used for teaching or self-studying.
  varngc: Penalized regressions on Vector Autoregressive models. The loss functions used include penalized least square and penalized log-likelihood. The penalty include lasso and group lasso. This package is parallelizable.
  t.regression: Contains regression models from UWaterloo&amp;rsquo;s STAT844 course instructed by Professor Liang Kun, adapted from the lecture notes of Professor Wayne Oldford.</description>

      <description>I recently submitted my thesis, which marks the end of my long and hard Ph.D. journey. Reflecting on my bumpy road, there are something I wish I knew. I think it will be beneficial to share my thoughts, in case they can help someone.
  The most important keys for success in any field is persistence and consistency. It will be very helpful to have a good working routine, diet and exercise.</description>

      <title>Why is Deep Learning good?</title>
      <link>https://tqtbui.github.io/miscs/blogs/why-dl/</link>

      <description>Thanks to the David Sprott&amp;rsquo;s Distinguished Lecture by Professor Trevor Hastie and the question raised by Professor Ali Ghodsi in the Q&amp;amp;A session today, I realized several things about Deep Learning. I think there are three main reasons why they are so good:
 Deep Learning is like a stack of simpler models. Simple models, such as linear models, are ensembled together into a certain, probably hierarchical, structure. Thus, Deep Learning models usually contain many more parameters than other classical models.</description>
