      <description>Below are R packages that I developed for the sole purpose of studying. Thus they will not be maintained. The codes are well-commented for step-by-step understanding of algorithms. These can be used for teaching or self-studying.
  varngc: Penalized regressions on Vector Autoregressive models. The loss functions used include penalized least square and penalized log-likelihood. The penalty include lasso and group lasso. This package is parallelizable.
  t.regression: Contains regression models from UWaterloo&amp;rsquo;s STAT844 course instructed by Professor Liang Kun, adapted from the lecture notes of Professor Wayne Oldford.</description>
